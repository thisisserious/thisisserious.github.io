#### A coding challenge for my Prime Digital Academy application
- As part of the application process to Prime, we were tasked with coding our résumés and deploying it to github pages. I chose to go with a simple and clean design, so I could focus on code cleanliness and usability. I wanted the page to resemble a piece of paper and consulted with a UX Designer who suggested a few design ideas to help it have a "floating" and more lively quality.
